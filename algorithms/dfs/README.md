# Depth-First Search (DFS)

Depth-First Search (DFS) is a traversal technique that explores as far down a branch as possible before backtracking.

Use this pattern for exploring all paths or branches in graphs or trees.

## Sample Problem:
Find all paths from the root to leaves in a binary tree.

### Example:

- Input: root = [1, 2, 3, null, 5]
- Output: ["1->2->5", "1->3"]

### Explanation:
1. Use recursion or a stack to traverse each path from the root to the leaves.
2. Record each path as you traverse.

## LeetCode Problems:
1. Clone Graph (LeetCode #133)
2. Path Sum II (LeetCode #113)
3. Course Schedule II (LeetCode #210)
