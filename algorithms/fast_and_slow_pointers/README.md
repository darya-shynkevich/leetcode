# Fast & Slow Pointers

The Fast & Slow Pointers (Tortoise and Hare) pattern is used to detect cycles in linked lists and other similar structures.

### Sample Problem:
Detect if a linked list has a cycle.

### Explanation:
1. Initialize two pointers, one moving one step at a time (slow) and the other moving two steps at a time (fast).
2. If there is a cycle, the fast pointer will eventually meet the slow pointer.
3. If the fast pointer reaches the end of the list, there is no cycle.

## LeetCode Problems:
1. Maximum Average Subarray I (LeetCode #643)
2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode #3)
3. Minimum Window Substring (LeetCode #76)
