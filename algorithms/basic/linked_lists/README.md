# Linked list

The In-place Reversal of a LinkedList pattern reverses parts of a linked list without using extra space.

Use this pattern when you need to reverse sections of a linked list.

### Sample Problem:
Reverse a sublist of a linked list from position m to n.

### Example:

Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], m = 2, n = 4
Output: [1, 4, 3, 2, 5]

### Explanation:
1. Identify the start and end of the sublist.
2. Reverse the nodes in place by adjusting the pointers.

## LeetCode Problems:
1. Reverse Linked List (LeetCode #206)
2. Reverse Linked List II (LeetCode #92)
3. Swap Nodes in Pairs (LeetCode #24)
