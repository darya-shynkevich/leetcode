# Sliding Window

The Sliding Window pattern is used to find a subarray or substring that satisfies a specific condition, optimizing the time complexity by maintaining a window of elements.

Use this pattern when dealing with problems involving contiguous subarrays or substrings.

### Sample Problem:
Find the maximum sum of a subarray of size k.

### Example:

- Input: nums = [2, 1, 5, 1, 3, 2], k = 3
- Output: 9

### Explanation:
1. Start with the sum of the first k elements.
2. Slide the window one element at a time, subtracting the element that goes out of the window and adding the new element.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

## LeetCode Problems:
1. Maximum Average Subarray I (LeetCode #643)
2. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (LeetCode #3)
3. Minimum Window Substring (LeetCode #76)
