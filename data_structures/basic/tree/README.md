Know least one type of balanced binary tree (and know how it's implemented):

"Among balanced search trees, AVL and 2/3 trees are now passé, and red-black trees seem to be more popular. A particularly interesting self-organizing data structure is the splay tree, which uses rotations to move any accessed key to the root." - Skiena

Of these, I chose to implement a splay tree. From what I've read, you won't implement a balanced search tree in your interview. But I wanted exposure to coding one up and let's face it, splay trees are the bee's knees. I did read a lot of red-black tree code.

1. splay tree: insert, search, delete functions If you end up implementing red/black tree try just these:
2. search and insertion functions, skipping delete

**AVL trees:**

In practice: From what I can tell, these aren't used much in practice, but I could see where they would be: The AVL tree is another structure supporting O(log n) search, insertion, and removal. It is more rigidly balanced than red–black trees, leading to slower insertion and removal but faster retrieval. This makes it attractive for data structures that may be built once and loaded without reconstruction, such as language dictionaries (or program dictionaries, such as the opcodes of an assembler or interpreter).

**Splay trees:**

In practice: Splay trees are typically used in the implementation of caches, memory allocators, routers, garbage collectors, data compression, ropes (replacement of string used for long text strings), in Windows NT (in the virtual memory, networking and file system code) etc.

**Red/black trees:**

these are a translation of a 2-3 tree (see below)

In practice: Red–black trees offer worst-case guarantees for insertion time, deletion time, and search time. Not only does this make them valuable in time-sensitive applications such as real-time applications, but it makes them valuable building blocks in other data structures which provide worst-case guarantees; for example, many data structures used in computational geometry can be based on red–black trees, and the Completely Fair Scheduler used in current Linux kernels uses red–black trees. In the version 8 of Java, the Collection HashMap has been modified such that instead of using a LinkedList to store identical elements with poor hashcodes, a Red-Black tree is used.

**2-3 search trees:**

In practice: 2-3 trees have faster inserts at the expense of slower searches (since height is more compared to AVL trees).

You would use 2-3 tree very rarely because its implementation involves different types of nodes. Instead, people use Red Black trees.

**2-3-4 Trees (aka 2-4 trees):**

In practice: For every 2-4 tree, there are corresponding red–black trees with data elements in the same order. The insertion and deletion operations on 2-4 trees are also equivalent to color-flipping and rotations in red–black trees. This makes 2-4 trees an important tool for understanding the logic behind red–black trees, and this is why many introductory algorithm texts introduce 2-4 trees just before red–black trees, even though 2-4 trees are not often used in practice.

**N-ary (K-ary, M-ary) trees:**

note: the N or K is the branching factor (max branches)

binary trees are a 2-ary tree, with branching factor = 2

1. 2-3 trees are 3-ary

**B-Trees:**

In Practice: B-Trees are widely used in databases. Most modern filesystems use B-trees (or Variants). In addition to its use in databases, the B-tree is also used in filesystems to allow quick random access to an arbitrary block in a particular file. The basic problem is turning the file block i address into a disk block (or perhaps to a cylinder-head-sector) address.

**k-D Trees:**

great for finding number of points in a rectangle or higher dimension object

a good fit for k-nearest neighbors
