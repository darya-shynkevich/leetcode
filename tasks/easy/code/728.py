# A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.
#
# For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
# A self-dividing number is not allowed to contain the digit zero.
#
# Given two integers left and right, return a list of all the self-dividing numbers in the range [left, right].

# Constraints:
#
# 1 <= left <= right <= 104
